This demo version application was developed to show the potential of the OPC UA standard. The app makes use of the official Java stack provided by the OPC Foundation at the following url:\nhttps://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-Java-Legacy, this stack is no longer supported today so the application may stop working in future release of the standard. In addition, the application uses a self-signed certificate, therefore problems may arise in the connection to servers that use Sign or Sign &amp; Encrypt authentication.
