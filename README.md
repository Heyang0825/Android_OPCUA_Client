# Android_OPCUA_Client
An Android OPC UA Client based on official OPC Foundation Java Stack

This demo version was developed to show the potential of the OPC UA standard. Today, this standard is relevant because it has been included in the main reference models of industrial architecture such as RAMI 4.0 and IIoT.
Developed by two students of the University of Catania (Italy) for the course of Industrial Informatics.
